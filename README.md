# Javascript port of zlib compressing base64 string

This is a quick demo shows how base64 string gets compressed by a javascript implmentation of zlib - http://www.zlib.net/


Compessed content reduced size to 75% of its original which results in smaller footprint over the transportation.

The compressed string can be easily decompressed by using java built-in class on the backend side.
